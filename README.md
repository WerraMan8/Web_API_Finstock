I found this Web API with CRUD functionality technical assessment extremely helpful in the context of my journey of picking up C# after learning Java in depth.
I approached this project with a few key steps:

- I dove into the fundamentals of C# to get a sense of the syntax (W3Schools was a fantastic resource).
- I compared core .NET concepts to similar concepts in Java and quickly gained understanding about the architecture of APIs in C#. Additionally how data flows through the API pipeline.
- I utilised AI to act as a project manager to help me structure the development lifecycle. This allowed me to get the most efficient development order of components required. Addtionally it allowed me to allocate time effectively.
- I used the AI to explain concepts to me instead of just giving me the code. This allowed me to build and implement features by myself instead of mindlessly pasting generated code to "Finish" the assessment.

This technical assessment gave me a good indication of key areas I need to focus on to take my C# coding and debugging skills to the next level.
